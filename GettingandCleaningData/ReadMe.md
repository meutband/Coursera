### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Files in repository:
- run_analysis.R : code for the analysis
- alldata.txt : data values for all mean and standard deviation features
- meandata.txt : data values for aggregated values
- CodeBook.md : description of the code and features
